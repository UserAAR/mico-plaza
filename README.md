  Built using <strong>PHP</strong> for the backend, the application leverages powerful features for data processing and management, while the <strong>frontend</strong> is crafted with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to provide an interactive and responsive user experience. The choice of technologies allows for flexibility and scalability, ensuring that the application can adapt to future enhancements and additional features.
